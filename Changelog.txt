Improved types inside the plugin tool.
Added another example for client side.
Paths inside of the plugin tool resolve accordingly.
Both environments now load correctly.

There is no support yet for server rendering of .marko pages when using node ./server.mjs/.js
A custom loader has to be made to bypass the default esm node loader if using node as the server. Others may be possible but are untested.

The plugin lets you use the client side as marko templates rendering with JS
 Use 'npm run dev' to edit.

 Server side can load rsbuild config (example in playground) with
   'node ./your/server.mjs/.js'
 but can only use the files with extensions that node initially allows.
 In theory, one should be able to create marko templates on client side and use them on the server side.

The loader problem is similar to why consolidate dropped support for marko, but the plugin works for client side.
